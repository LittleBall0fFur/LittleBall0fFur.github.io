              <p>My biggest hobby is gaming. I play many different games, but the game I play most is currently World of Warcraft. Most of the games I play are multiplayer games to be able to play with friends. The genre's I mostly play are MOBA's, MMO, Survival and RTS. I love gaming because of the stories the games tell and the competitiveness between players.</p>

                  <td><p>World of Warcraft is the biggest MMO currently out there. The game fully story driven and is enjoyable with friends. The game plays in the world of Azeroth where the player can create his own character and discover the world around. In the game the player will resolve problems around the world and save it. </p></td>

                  <td><p id="Align">Heroes of the Storm is a MOBA game which means it is played in team of 5. The teams face off against each other in an arena like battleground. The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy base. In the game there are multiple ways to win depending on the heroes and the battleground the teams are playing. Since Heroes of the Storm is an Esports this game is very competitive in all levels of play. </p></td>

Everything in the game wants to kill you. This is possibly the hardest multiplayer game I have ever played and is not recommended for everyone. The game is very frustrating and yet very rewarding. </p></td>

One game with friends lasts for at least twenty hours to complete. The game is slow paced and very relaxing to play. </p></td>

I made the controller at home in about 3 weeks. the game I worked on a bit longer about ten weeks. To the left you can see the design I made for my controller, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/yRVPx" id="Artstation">here</a> you can find the photo's of the controller.<br><br> The game is a god-like game. In the game you are a magician that wants to obtain a magic book that is guarded by the armies of heaven. The player controls a daemon that moves on command of the staff.</td>
